# NexusWars: AI-Powered DeFi Strategy Game Platform

A blockchain-based platform that combines algorithmic trading, game theory, and artificial intelligence to create a competitive strategy game where players build, train, and deploy AI agents to compete in simulated DeFi markets.

## Core Concept

Players create "Trading Legions" - collections of AI agents that:
1. Compete in simulated DeFi markets
2. Learn from historical market data
3. Earn real yields from deployed strategies
4. Can be traded, merged, and evolved
5. Form alliances and compete in tournaments

## Technical Components

### 1. AI Agent System

```move
struct TradingAgent has key {
    id: UID,
    genome: vector<u8>,          // Neural network weights
    performance_history: vector<TradeResult>,
    specialization: AgentType,
    experience: u64,
    evolution_stage: u8,
    mutation_rate: u64,
    training_data: vector<MarketData>,
    metadata: Table<String, String>
}

struct AgentType has copy, drop {
    primary_strategy: u8,        // 0: Arbitrage, 1: Market Making, 2: Trend Following...
    risk_profile: u8,           // Risk tolerance level
    market_focus: vector<u8>,   // Which markets/pairs it specializes in
    time_horizon: u64           // Trading timeframe preference
}
```

### 2. Market Simulation Engine
